# Whoami

I'm **0xYur3i**, a Penetration Tester and Security Consultant based in Malaysia.  

My work revolves around offensive security — with a focus on:

- Web application testing  
- Network assessments  
- Active Directory exploitation  
- Red team techniques  

I’m certified in **OSCP, PNPT, CPTS**, and hold a **Splunk User cert** — because understanding logs is just as important as creating them.

- Record practical knowledge  
- Share insights with others  
- Build something meaningful over time  
- Stay focused and consistent

## A Little More About Me

I work quietly and think deeply.  
I prefer late-night sessions with a terminal over busy rooms.  
Caffeine helps. So does good music.  

This blog isn’t for attention — it’s to reflect growth, one step at a time.

## What Drives Me

> Grind now before life grinds you.  

There’s no rush to be seen — just a constant effort to improve.  
One post. One test. One breakthrough at a time.  

If you're here to learn, I hope this helps.  
If you're here to build, you’re in the right place.
